Roelfs, A.P. 1989. Epidemiology of cerial rusts in North America. Can J. Plant Pathol. 11:86-90.

Severe epidemics were in 1916, 1919, 1935-7, 1950-54.
Spatial variation in a field of wheat development: Masle-Meynard and Sebillotte 1981.

Phenology is external development.

Plants that have received a first inoculation of rust do not appear to react to later inoculations.

Frequency of days with six or more hours of moisture (dew) at 10 C or higher is what correlates best with infection.

Ed. by Brett F. Carver, Wheat Science and Trade. 2009. Ch. 5. Diseass which challenge global wheat production - the Wheat Rusts. by James Kolmer, Xianming Chen, Yue Jin. pg 89-124. Epidemics happen in Spring wheat and Durum in MN, SD, ND. Also says infection temperatures are 15-24 C, with a max of 30C, and growth temps are 25-35 C with a max of 40 C. Dew at six housr optimal for germination and infection.
